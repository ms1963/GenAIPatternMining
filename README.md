# GenAIPatternMining
Patterns proposed by OpenAiâ€™s o1-mini model.

Pattern mining is the process where engineers try to figure out new pattern candidates. Due to the GenAI revolution, the idea merges to use LLMs for pattern mining. When OpenAI GPT family (o1-mini) is used, the system reports back potential patterns that are still undocumented - at laest the LLM, thinks they are.
I used the simple prompt:

_Are there any (candidates for) design or architecture patterns that are still undocument, but that you found in your knowledge base? If yes, describe them as pattern templates._

In patterns.md, there are nine suggested pattern candidates.
Decide for youself whether these pattern candidates qualify as patterns.
